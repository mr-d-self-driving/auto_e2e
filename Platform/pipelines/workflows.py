    """Label each 1 Hz World-Model sample with a TEMPORAL front-camera clip, then
    write a versioned label artifact for the data_processing JOIN.

    Reasoning is a 1 Hz, temporal concern: the teacher is shown one FRONT-camera
    frame per horizon (0 s current + 1/2/3/4 s future) so it can reason about how
    the scene evolves (cut-ins, stops, yields) instead of guessing from a single
    instant with many cameras. Both datasets expose ``get_front_clip(idx)`` in a
    light-weight ``reasoning_clip_only`` mode that decodes ONLY those 5 front
    frames (L2D via lerobot delta_timestamps; NVIDIA via a sparse front-camera
    PyAV decode) — far cheaper than the full multi-view World-Model window.

    Labels are keyed by the parser's GLOBAL ``sample_uid`` (#121 §3.1), so the
    JOIN to ``data_processing`` holds even when labeling and packing run over
    different episode-range shards. Both L2D and NVIDIA are labelled (NVIDIA is no longer
    skipped): ``reasoning_clip_only`` does not change either dataset's sample set.

    There is NO per-sample S3 cache (#121 §3.4): the teacher is called once per
    sample of this partition and all records aggregate into ONE ``records.jsonl``.
    Re-label protection is the Flyte task cache on the deterministic partition —
    an unchanged partition is a task-cache no-op (no Cosmos call); a changed
    ``teacher`` / ``prompt_version`` (both in the cache key) correctly misses, so
    the temporal-clip / front-only / 256px prompt change re-labels cleanly.

    Returns:
        FlyteDirectory with a whole-record ``records.jsonl`` (the JOIN
        interchange data_processing reads), the flattened
        ``reasoning_labels_v2.{parquet,jsonl}`` analytics export, and a
        provenance ``meta.json``.

    The scale fix for wf_create_dataset: instead of one pod ingesting+labeling+
    packing ALL episodes (which OOMs as episodes grow), split the episodes into
    partitions and run an independent ingest→label→pack chain per partition, each
    a separate Flyte node (so each retries independently and caches independently,
    §3.4a). Returns the per-partition shard dirs as a ``List[FlyteDirectory]`` —
    exactly what ``train_il(shards=...)`` / ``make_multi_dataset_loader`` already
    consume (train sees one merged stream over all partitions).

    Option B: each partition's ``data_ingest`` materializes ONLY its episodes as a
    raw FlyteDirectory; that partition's label+pack read it (root=raw dir), so HF
    is hit once per partition and downstream pods never re-fetch. Because the

    boundary (§3.1) — partitions never collide and train/val split stays group-
    clean across the whole fan-out.
