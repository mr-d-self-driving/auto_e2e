# Data parsing recipe for [KIT Scenes Multimodal Dataset](https://kitscenes.com/multimodal/)

Parser for the KITScenes Multimodal dataset, producing tensors directly consumable by AutoE2E's `forward()`.

KITScenes ships per-frame JPEGs (not video), 6-DOF ego poses in `poses.txt`, and Lanelet2 HD maps. Cameras and ego poses share the 10 Hz reference timeline, so a single `frame_idx` indexes both. The four egomotion signals are *derived* from the pose stream by finite differencing — KITScenes does not store velocity/acceleration/curvature columns.

## Setup

The dataset is loaded through the [`kitscenes`](https://github.com/KIT-MRT/kitscenes) Python API. Constraints: Linux x86_64, Python 3.8–3.12.

### KITScenes SDK

```bash
cd Model/data_parsing/kit_scenes
git clone https://github.com/KIT-MRT/kitscenes.git && cd kitscenes
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -e . --no-deps
```

### Lanelet2

`generate_bev_map_tile` in `map.py` calls `get_lanelets_in_roi` which relies on `lanelet2` to parse the underlying vector map data. Install `lanelet2` using `pip`:
```bash
pip install lanelet2
``` 

If you encounter errors like `No matching distribution found for lanelet2`, install the pre-compiled C++ binaries and Python bindings using the RoboStack Conda channel instead:

```bash
conda install -c robostack-staging ros-humble-lanelet2-python
```

Without Lanelet2, map tiles fall back to zero tensors and the dataset still functions.


## Model inputs produced

- `visual_tiles` `(7, 3, H, W)` — 7 camera frames
- `map_tile` `(3, H, W)` — BEV map tile (rasterization of Lanelet2 HD map)
- `egomotion_history` `(256,)` — fixed model ABI: 64 past timesteps × 4 signals at 10 Hz
- `visual_history` `(896,)` — zero-initialised placeholder; populated during sequential inference
- `trajectory_target` `(128,)` — fixed model ABI: 64 future timesteps × 2 signals
- `camera_params` `(7, 3, 4)` — projection matrices `P = K_scaled @ T_ref_to_cam` for the 7 camera views, computed from KITScenes calibration and scaled to match the backbone's resize/crop transform. 


The 7 camera views are the hi-res front camera plus the 6 surround ring cameras (`CAMERA_NAMES` in `camera.py`). The stereo front pair is dropped as it duplicates forward coverage.

### Egomotion history signals `(256,) = 64 × 4`

All four are derived from `poses.txt` (TUM format) by finite differencing on the real, possibly uneven, pose timestamps.

- `[0]` Speed (m/s) — `‖d/dt translation_xy‖`
- `[1]` Acceleration (m/s^2) — `d/dt speed`
- `[2]` Yaw rate (rad/s) — time derivative of unwrapped quaternion yaw
- `[3]` Curvature (1/m) — `yaw_rate / speed`, with speed floored at 0.1 m/s

### Trajectory target signals `(128,) = 64 × 2`

- `[0]` Acceleration (m/s^2)
- `[1]` Curvature (1/m)

## Sampling

A sample is a `(scene_id, frame_idx)` pair, where `frame_idx` indexes the 10 Hz reference timeline. A `frame_idx` is valid when there are 64 frames behind it (history window) and 64 ahead (target window), within the span covered by *both* the ego poses and the camera frames. The current frame is excluded from both windows — history is `[idx-64, idx-1]`, target is `[idx+1, idx+64]`. A scene with `N` usable reference frames therefore yields `N − 128` valid samples.

All valid pairs are enumerated at construction time, and per-scene derived arrays (egomotion, scene-local positions, camera projection matrices) are cached then. `__getitem__` does I/O only.

The 64/64 layout is the AutoE2E model and training contract, not an L2D-derived
KITScenes override. Training and internal model selection retain all 64 history
and target rows. `training.dataset_policy.KITSCENES_TRAINING_POLICY` changes only
corpus-specific behavior: target signal scales, the frozen scene holdout, and
masking the latest history acceleration stored in v2 shards because its centered
finite-difference stencil reads one post-anchor pose. The separate KITScenes
benchmark evaluator applies the protocol's four-second observation window and
reports the required 30-row and 50-row metrics without changing training.

Internal model selection uses the frozen scene manifest at
`training/splits/kitscenes_train_dev_v1.json`. Training verifies the packed
partition count, empty-scene count, source revision, v2.2 pack contract,
eligible scene digest, and complete sample UID digest before using its 40
validation scenes (3,820 samples). The remaining 364 scenes contain 38,847
training samples. A partial or different artifact set does not silently
generate a replacement holdout.


## Usage

```python
from data_parsing.kit_scenes import KitScenesDataset
from torch.utils.data import DataLoader

# Whole split for training
dataset = KitScenesDataset(
    data_root="/path/to/kitscenes/data",   # the $KITSCENES_ROOT directory
    backbone_name="swinv2_tiny_window8_256",
    split="train",
)

# Single scene for forward pass validation
dataset = KitScenesDataset(
    data_root="/path/to/kitscenes/data",
    backbone_name="swinv2_tiny_window8_256",
    scene_ids=["c34c778f-ad8c-0aa9-7e1a-c86a73f887c7"],
)

loader = DataLoader(dataset, batch_size=8, shuffle=True, num_workers=4)

# Training loop
for batch in loader:
    visual_tiles = batch["visual_tiles"].to(device)           # (B, 7, 3, H, W)
    map_tile = batch["map_tile"].to(device)                   # (B, 3, H, W)
    visual_history = batch["visual_history"].to(device)       # (B, 896)
    egomotion_history = batch["egomotion_history"].to(device) # (B, 256)
    trajectory_target = batch["trajectory_target"].to(device) # (B, 128)
    camera_params = batch["camera_params"].to(device)         # (B, 7, 3, 4)

    planner_loss, ego_hidden, future_visual_features = model(
        visual_tiles,
        map_tile,
        visual_history,
        egomotion_history,
        camera_params=camera_params,
        trajectory_target=trajectory_target,
        mode="train",
    )

# Inference
trajectory, ego_hidden, _ = model(
    visual_tiles,
    map_tile,
    visual_history,
    egomotion_history,
    camera_params=camera_params,
    mode="infer",
)
```

## Image preprocessing

Preprocessing is derived at runtime from the backbone's own config via timm, so normalisation, resize, and crop match the backbone's training:

```python
data_config = timm.data.resolve_model_data_config(backbone)
transform = timm.data.create_transform(**data_config, is_training=False)
```

## BEV map tile

### Rasterized maps (temporary, pending vectorized encoder)

`map.generate_bev_map_tile` rasterizes a semantic, ego-centric tile from the scene's Lanelet2 HD map using OpenCV: road borders, lane dividers, centerlines, stop lines, and pedestrian crossings, coloured to mirror the SDK's `lanelet2_ml_converter` conventions. The tile is rotated so the ego heading points up (forward = up, left = left).

Ego poses and the lanelet boundaries share the scene-local frame (metres from the map origin, axes aligned with UTM 32N); the tile is centred by subtracting the ego position, so the absolute offset cancels. 

**Important:** This rasterized map implementation for this dataset is **only applicable if the model will train using raster map representations**. The architecture is designed to support both vectorized (implementation pending) and rasterized map encoders. The `map.py` module serves as a reference implementation should rasterized maps be needed in the future.


### Benchmarking on-demand vs. pre-rendered maps

**Note:** The `rasterize_map_at_runtime` flag is provided for benchmarking. Currently, setting it to `False` (by running `forward_pass_test` with the `--no-rasterize-maps` flag) uses zero tensor fallback; actual pre-rendered raster map tile loading is not yet implemented.

- `rasterize_map_at_runtime=True` (default): On-demand runtime rasterization of Lanelet2 map tiles via `map.generate_bev_map_tile`
- `rasterize_map_at_runtime=False`: Zero tensor fallback, representative of scenarios without map data or pre-rendered/cached maps

## Forward pass test

Run from the repo root's `Model` directory. Use the absolute `$KITSCENES_ROOT` for `--dataset_root`:

```bash
cd Model/data_parsing/kit_scenes
python forward_pass_test.py \
    --dataset_root "$KITSCENES_ROOT" \
    --scene_id c34c778f-ad8c-0aa9-7e1a-c86a73f887c7
```

Whole split, or offline/CI without pretrained weights:

```bash
python forward_pass_test.py --dataset_root "$KITSCENES_ROOT" --split train
python forward_pass_test.py --dataset_root "$KITSCENES_ROOT" --scene_id <uuid> --no-pretrained
```

The test exercises both inference (`mode="infer"`) and training (`mode="train"`) modes with BEV fusion, including camera projection matrices.
