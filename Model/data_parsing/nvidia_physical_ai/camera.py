"""Camera frame loading for the NVIDIA PhysicalAI-Autonomous-Vehicles dataset.

The dataset provides 7 real cameras. It has NO rendered map tile, so the map
branch receives a zero tensor (``make_map_tile``) until a renderer is
integrated. The map is NOT a camera view: it is kept out of ``visual_tiles`` (so
it never enters the camera BEV projection) and routed to the model's separate
map branch. Hence ``NUM_VIEWS = 7``.
