class BEVViewFusion(nn.Module):
    """Fuse multi-view features into a BEV representation via learned sparse grid sampling.

    Simplified variant inspired by BEVFormer's spatial cross-attention:
    learnable BEV queries attend to multi-camera image features at
    geometry-guided 3D reference points projected onto each camera's
    image plane. No explicit depth prediction is needed.

    This is a simplified single-head implementation that does not fully
    replicate BEVFormer's multi-head deformable attention. It serves as
    a functional BEV fusion module suitable for experimentation and as a
    foundation for a full BEVFormer-style implementation.

    Camera Parameters Convention:
        camera_params: [B, num_views, 3, 4] matrices that project
        homogeneous 3D ego/vehicle-frame coordinates to 2D pixel coordinates.

        Expected to be: intrinsic @ extrinsic (ego-to-pixel)
        - extrinsic: [3, 4] or [4, 4] ego/vehicle-frame-to-camera transform
        - intrinsic: [3, 3] camera matrix (focal length, principal point)
        - Combined: [3, 4] = intrinsic @ extrinsic[:3, :]

        The BEV reference points are defined in ego/vehicle frame (centered
        on the vehicle, X=forward, Y=left, Z=up). camera_params must
        transform these ego-frame coordinates to pixel coordinates.

        Output of projection: [u, v, depth] in pixel coordinates where
        - u: horizontal pixel (0 to image_width)
        - v: vertical pixel (0 to image_height)
        - depth: distance along camera optical axis (positive = in front)

        The module normalizes pixel coords to [0, 1] using the provided
        image_size parameter (default: 256, matching square input resolution).

        Geometry is supplied to ``forward`` as a projection operator (see
        ``projection.py``): pass a ``[B, V, 3, 4]`` ``camera_params`` matrix
        (wrapped as a :class:`PinholeProjection`), or a pre-built ``projection``
        operator (e.g. :class:`FThetaProjection` for native fisheye), or request
        the calibration-free path explicitly with ``geometry_type="pseudo"``.
        The pseudo path uses a learnable ``pseudo_projection`` prior; it does NOT
        learn true camera geometry — it is a fixed learned spatial prior for
        sampling locations. For meaningful BEV projection, real calibration is
        required, and the fusion module never falls into the pseudo path on
        behalf of a caller that meant to pass real calibration.

        The module is runtime-``V``-dynamic: one instance consumes batches of any
        camera count. ``num_views`` only sizes the default pseudo-prior expansion
        and is not otherwise baked into any tensor shape.
