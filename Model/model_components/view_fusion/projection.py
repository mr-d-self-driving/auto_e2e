"""Differentiable camera projection operators for BEV view fusion.

The contract of ``BEVViewFusion`` with geometry is NOT a fixed ``[B, V, 3, 4]``
matrix. It is a *projection operator*: something that maps ego-frame BEV
reference points to sampling coordinates on each camera's model-input image
plane, plus a visibility mask. A pinhole ``K @ T`` matrix is only ONE such
operator (its linear fast path). Fisheye (f-theta) cameras need a non-linear
operator, and a calibration-free run needs a learnable pseudo operator. All
expose the same :meth:`project_ego_to_image` so the fusion module never branches
on camera model.

Design (per the Issue #77 discussion):
    - The public contract is :class:`CameraProjectionModel`, not ``K @ T``. A
      pinhole matrix lives *inside* :class:`PinholeProjection` as a fast path.
    - Native fisheye is a first-class :class:`FThetaProjection`; we do not force
      it through a pinhole (which would lose FOV). Rectification, when wanted, is
      expressed as an :class:`ImageTransform` + a ``rectified_pinhole`` operator,
      not by pretending a fisheye is a pinhole.
    - Projection is defined against the *model-input* image frame, so the image
      side (resize/crop/pad/rectification) is part of the contract via
      :class:`ImageTransform` — a projection that is correct on the raw image but
      not on the resized tensor would sample the wrong pixels.

Coordinate convention: reference points are in the ego/vehicle frame,
X=forward, Y=left, Z=up, in metres. :meth:`project_ego_to_image` returns pixel
coordinates normalized to ``[0, 1]`` by the model-input width/height, a
visibility mask, the per-point depth/range, and a metadata dict recording the
geometry that produced the result.

Reference:
    - BEVFormer (Li et al., ECCV 2022): spatial cross-attention. Its essence is
      "each BEV query samples relevant regions from each camera view"; the
      projection being a pinhole matrix is an implementation detail, not the
      contract.
    - NVIDIA PhysicalAI-AV sensor model: native f-theta (fisheye), motivating a
      non-linear projection operator rather than a pinhole-only ABI.

    Native pixel frame (important): ``cx/cy`` and ``fw_poly`` are kept in the

        max_theta: incidence-angle FOV cutoff (radians); the upper bound of the
