"""Optional System 2 causal reasoning head (Issue #17).

A lightweight auxiliary head that takes a context vector (e.g. the planner's
``ego_hidden``) and produces:

  * ``reasoning_latent`` — a continuous latent that can condition the
    planner downstream (cascade design),
  * ``decision_logits`` — a 5-way classification over the dominant causal
    factor of the current scene.

Training signal: ``causal_consistency_loss`` (cross-entropy) against
pseudo-labels produced by a VLM (vision-language model) prompted over the
KITScenes LongTail dataset. The labels are therefore noisy pseudo-labels,
not human ground truth; the head is auxiliary and OPTIONAL — it does not
modify AutoE2E's default forward pass or its 3-tuple return contract.

Cascade requirement: gradients must flow from the reasoning outputs back to
the trunk that produced the context vector (no ``torch.no_grad`` anywhere),
so that the auxiliary objective shapes the shared representation.
