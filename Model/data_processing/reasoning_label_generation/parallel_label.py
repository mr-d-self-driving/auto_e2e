"""Process-parallel offline reasoning labeling (#98).

The offline labeler is decode-bound: building each sample's temporal front clip
decodes the 1 Hz World-Model window, and lerobot's reader is NOT thread-safe, so
a ThreadPool had to serialize decode under a lock — which left the (many) vLLM
replicas idle. Processes each own an independent dataset + reader, so decode runs
truly in parallel across CPU cores and the teacher calls overlap, finally using
the scaled-out Cosmos endpoint.

Design:
  * ``init_worker`` builds ONE per-process dataset + teacher + label cache
    (constructed once, reused for every sample that process handles).
  * ``label_sample`` (module-level, picklable) does: cache.get → on miss decode
    the front clip + call the teacher + cache.put (only successful records).
Only the small sample index is sent across the process boundary; frames never
cross it. Spawn context is used (torch is imported), so workers re-import this
module cleanly without dragging in the Flyte task module.
